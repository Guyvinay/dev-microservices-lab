Documentation of the JSON module structure.
This page describes the short forms of data attributes used in the JSON file.

## Base attributes on the JSON ##

1. hdvs => It is the Header Data structure of the module.
    a. structId    : It's the numeric ID of a structure in MDO to identify a Hierarchy. For header structure, we have structId 1 reserved.
    b. description : The description (name) of a structure (Hierarchy). Header Data is constant here.
    c. fields      : List of fields on the structure (Header Data).

2. hyvs => It contains all the Hierarchies (including child) of the module. It has list of hierarchies with its description and all fields.
    1. structId    : It's the numeric ID of a structure in MDO to identify a Hierarchy.
    2. description : The description (name) of a structure (Hierarchy).
    3. fields      : List of fields on the structure (Hierarchy).

3. gvs => It contains all the Grid Tables which usually lies in the Header Data of a module. It has list of Grid Tables with its description and all fields.
    1. grdId       : It's the Field ID of the Grid Table in MDO to identify it.
    2. description : The description (name) of a Grid Table.
    3. fields      : List of fields on the Grid Table.


## Field attributes on the JSON ##

1. fldId    : MDO Field ID
2. length   : Maximum allowed character limit. If any data comes beyond this limit, record will not be validated.
3. desc     : Description (name) of the field in MDO.
4. keyField : true/false
    1. true  : It means, it is a Key Field on the Hierarchy or Grid. It must always have a valid (not empty, not null) data.
    2. false : It means, it is just a normal Field on a Header, Hierarchy or Grid.
5. dataType : Accepted data type on a field.
6. txtCase : None/UPPER/LOWER
    1. None  : Default value, meaning it can have both Uppercase & lowercase letters.
    2. UPPER : The field value must contain only uppercase letters.
    3. LOWER : The field value must contain only lowercase letters.
